# This Project is about Collecting/Scrapping News Articles
## The package used to achieve this functionality is Scrapy(v.2.11.0). This is an open-source web crawling and web scraping framework that can be used to extract structured data from websites. 
### Scrapy is similar to Miniconda since both are controlled by the command-line prompt. 
### in this case: 
```
scrapy
```
