Headline:
      ‘Shazam!’ Fury of the Gods’ can’t catch lightning in a bottle twice
    
 Summary: 
	'Shazam! Fury of the Gods' falls short as a sequel, lacking the charm and novelty of the original. New villains, played by Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu, fail to elevate the film. Despite flashy effects, the movie feels shallow and lacks the magic of its predecessor, indicating the franchise may have run its course.
