Imagine reading a holographic recipe in the corner of your eye while cooking, for example, or staring at furniture parts with digital assembly instructions overlaid on them.But for now, the devices are primarily used for playing games, and killer apps have yet to surface.Meta’s $500 Quest 3 headset, arriving in stores on Oct. 10 (pre-orders start on Wednesday), has sharper graphics than its predecessor, the Quest 2, which costs $200 less. Its marquee new feature is a set of high-resolution, “pass-through” cameras for seeing the outside world in color.

The ability to simultaneously interact with virtual and physical space, the company said, would make it easier for people to feel connected to one another while wearingTo market the Quest 3, Meta highlighted mixed reality games.

Naer is a start-up working on a mixed-reality app for office workers to brainstorm ideas on virtual white boards and sticky notes. Developers there said that being able to see into the real world while juggling virtual tasks would make the experience less jarring for “When you’re fully closed off and somebody taps your shoulder, it’s very uncomfortable,” said Sondre Kvam, a founder of the company, which is based in Norway. “But when you’re using mixed reality, youPeeking into the outside world might also make V.R. gaming more comfortable. Tommy Palm, the chief executive of Resolution Games, said that in mixed reality, gamers would probably feel more confident playing games that involved fast movement.In his game Blaston, where players shoot guns at each other in a virtual arena, people can crouch to avoid digital projectiles. Being able to see around you would help prevent collisions with objects Those examples of mixed reality sound convincing. But after spending a few hours with the Quest 3, I got the impression that the outward-facing cameras won’t solve virtual reality’s most nagging problWeighing about a pound, the headset felt heavy on my head after about 15 minutes, causing neck strain.
